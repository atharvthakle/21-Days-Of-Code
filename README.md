# 21-Days-Of-Code

An intensive coding event organized by IEEE SB of Manipal University - Jaipur, where solve a variety of problems. This event focused on two domains - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Web Development. Among the two, my chosen domain was DSA. It was hosted on the Code Blocks platform. This repository contains my solutions to the problems presented during the event, using which I secured first rank among the (number) participants.

## Structure

This directory contains the solutions to all the problems in primarily Python, but sometimes C and C++ as well.

Directories are categorised as :

## Note

Although the event is named "21 Days of Code", but only 13 days of coding challenges were provided. On weekends there were no challenges on platform so the days might have been reduced there. The number of days in the repository is correct, and the repository is complete based on the provided challenges.
